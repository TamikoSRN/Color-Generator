# Tamiko's Color-Generator

## Why would I do this?

Because I'm always needing some colors for my css projects, so I thought, why not just killing 2 birds with one shot and creating my very own generator?
I mean, it also could be a very good practice tho ^^

### For this project, I just used React/hooks and CSS.
